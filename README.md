## Data and Viz of Interest

*Check out this interesting Humanities Article: [Spotify Wrapped: Hereâ€™s How Spotify Calculates Your Listening Data](https://www.forbes.com/sites/antoniopequenoiv/2023/11/29/spotify-wrapped-heres-how-spotify-calculates-your-listening-data/)*

One data visualization I would like to know how to make with Python is a word cloud as it is a unique data visualization that I have not previously seen in coding. It is useful to easily display a lot of data about word frequency/common themes in an easy-to-comprehend manner.

## Ideas from Curated Datasets and Project Lists

Dataset Name | Description | Link to Data
--- | --- | ---
Metadata on the paintings of Bob Ross | The data is a csv file with each of Bob Ross's paintings and a 1 for if the painting contains that element, and 0 otherwise. I think coding can useful to find the most common elements/themes in Ross's paintings, find relationships between the elements of his paintings (such as if we can find what elements are commonly found in different frames), and even analyze how Ross typically names is paintings. | https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/bob-ross
Predict Students' Dropout and Academic Success | The dataset includes over 4000 instances of 36 features about undergraduate students, including as their academics, demographics, socioeconomic factors, and classifies if they are still enrolled, dropped out, or graduated by the end of the term. This dataset can be interesting to analyze to see the common factors for each category of student, and see what plays more significant roles in students' success in school. I think being able to plot these points or calculate averages for different elements can help make the data more clear and open up opportunity for more questions. We can also train a model to predict a student's status using this dataset. | https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/697/predict+students+dropout+and+academic+success
FMA: A Dataset For Music Analysis | This dataset includes over 100,000 songs with metadata including the title, genre, play counts, audio, and comments. This data can be investigated to see the properties of the most popular songs, or to do a sentiment analysis on the comments sections to determine if the track has high streams because people actually like listening to the song. | https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/386/fma+a+dataset+for+music+analysis
